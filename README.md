## Introduction
The purpose of this application is to give the user a graphical user interface for the Radiance/HDRGen pipeline process. The program works by taking in image files and calibration files in order in order to return light calculated images containing radiance, lumiance and color. The application is intended for interior light design researchers who are concerned with how lighting in a room affects visual discomfort.

## Platforms
This application runs on MacOS, Windows and Linux.

## Getting Started
The user must install [Radiance](https://www.radiance-online.org/) to their local machine and have acces to its location as well as [HDRGen](http://www.anyhere.com/).
