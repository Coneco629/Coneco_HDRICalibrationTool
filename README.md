# HDRI-Calibration-Tool


---
## About
The HDRI Calibration Tool was designed to automate the process of merging multiple LDR images together and generating an HDR image. It is not a standalone app, and is meant to be used alongside the app Radiance. This is an entirely free,open-sourced application developed by a small group of computer science students.

To read more about the process of generating an HDR image from LDR image input, see the research paper by Clotilde Pierson [here](https://doi.org/10.1080/15502724.2019.1684319).

## Other Documentation
If you have any difficulty using the application, please check out our [github Wiki](https://github.com/XiangyuLijoey/HDRICalibrationTool/wiki) for more information.

Additionally, the GitHub Wiki includes OS-specific information regarding installation, troubleshooting, and setting up a development environment to make changes to the app.

A step-by-step guide on using the app is also on the wiki, with a formatting guide for the calibration and response function files.

It also includes information about the development of this project including libraries used, more info about the radiance_pipeline submodule, using Figma to prototype and test design on users, and documentation for functions in some of the files.
