# HDRI-Calibration-Tool

HDRI Calibration Tool was designed to automate the process of merging multiple LDR images together and generating an HDR image. It is not a standalone app, and is meant to be used alongside the app Radiance. This is an entirely free,open-sourced application developed by a small group of computer science students.  

To read more about the process of generating an HDR image from LDR image input, see the research paper by Clotilde Pierson [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qsz_XRwYatku_1YtNC-kbFxNRNs4Izno/view?usp=sharing).

If you have any difficulty interacting with the application, please check out our [github Wiki](https://github.com/XiangyuLijoey/HDRICalibrationTool/wiki) for more information.
