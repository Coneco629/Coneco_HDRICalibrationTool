# HDRI-Calibration-Tool

The HDRI Calibration Tool was designed to automate the process of merging multiple LDR images together and generating an HDR image. It is not a standalone app, and is meant to be used alongside the app Radiance. This is an entirely free,open-sourced application developed by a small group of computer science students.

To read more about the process of generating an HDR image from LDR image input, see the research paper by Clotilde Pierson [here](https://doi.org/10.1080/15502724.2019.1684319).

If you have any difficulty using the application, please check out our [github Wiki](https://github.com/XiangyuLijoey/HDRICalibrationTool/wiki) for more information.

Additionally, the GitHub Wiki includes OS-specific information regarding installation, troubleshooting, and setting up a development environment to make changes to the app.
